        A little knowledge can go a long way <br>
        A lot of professionals are crackpots <br>
        A man can't know what it is to be a mother  <br>
        A name means a lot just by itself <br>
        A positive attitude means all the difference in the world <br>
        A relaxed man is not necessarily a better man <br>
        A sense of timing is the mark of genius <br>
        A sincere effort is all you can ask <br>
        A single event can have infinitely many interpretations <br>
        A solid home base builds a sense of self  <br>
        A strong sense of duty imprisons you  <br>
        Absolute submission can be a form of freedom  <br>
        Abstraction is a type of decadence  <br>
        Abuse of power comes as no surprise <br>
        Action causes more trouble than thought <br>
        Alienation produces eccentrics or revolutionaries <br>
        All things are delicately interconnected  <br>
        Ambition is just as dangerous as complacency  <br>
        Ambivalence can ruin your life  <br>
        An elite is inevitable  <br>
        Anger or hate can be a useful motivating force  <br>
        Animalism is perfectly healthy  <br>
        Bad intentions can yield good results <br>
        Being alone with yourself is increasingly unpopular <br>
        Being happy is more important than anything else <br>
        Being judgmental is a sign of life <br>
        Being sure of yourself means you're a fool <br>
        Believing in rebirth is the same as admitting defeat <br>
        Boredom makes you do crazy things <br>
        Calm is more conductive to creativity than is anxiety <br>
        Categorizing fear is calming <br>
        Change is valuable when the oppressed become tyrants <br>
        Chasing the new is dangerous to society <br>
        Children are the most cruel of all <br>
        Children are the hope of the future <br>
        Class action is a nice idea with no substance <br>
        Class structure is as artificial as plastic <br>
        decadence can be an end in itself <br>
        Decency is a relative thing <br>
        Dependence can be a meal ticket <br>
        Description is more important than metaphor <br>
        Deviants are sacrificed to increase group solidarity <br>
        Disgust is the appropriate response to most situations <br>
        Disorganization is a kind of anesthesia <br>
        Don't place to much trust in experts <br>
        Drama often obscures the real issues <br>
        Dreaming while awake is a frightening contradiction <br>
        Dying and coming back gives you considerable perspective <br>
        Dying should be as easy as falling off a log <br>
