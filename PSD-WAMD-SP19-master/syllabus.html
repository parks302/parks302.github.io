	<h2>Syllabus</h2>

	<h3>Derrick Schultz</h3>
	<p><a href="mailto:schultzd@newschool.edu">schultzd@newschool.edu</a></p>

	<h3>Course Description</h3>
	<p>Mobile devices are now the most common way for people to interact with digitial experiences and each other. In this course we will explore designinging for these devices while solving user problems, connecting them to their community, and entertaining them in ways never before available. The class will be divided into two parts: a series of quick provocations exploring concepts of the modern web, and one complete mobile project that explores these concepts in a cohesive product while iterating based on user feedback. Throughout this course you will be asked to consider the design principles of previous interaction design classes and utlitize critical thinking, user research, and presentation skills.</p>

	<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
	<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the core tenets of the modern web and how they shape our experiences on it</li>
		<li>Understand and utilize the design constraints—both in aesthetics and usability—of mobile products</li>
		<li>Gain valuable experience in speaking to and interacting with users and learning to iterate on a product based on their feedback and use</li>
		<li>Developing a design process that begins with a problem to solve</li>
		<li>Develop a mobile product from a design brief to a working prototype</li>
		<li>Provide useful critique of colleagues’ work that is respectful and focused on problem solving</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Assessable Tasks</h3>
	<p><strong>Provocations</strong> Due March 5th. Submitted as Figma file. Provocations should show a wide range of explorations into the concepts presented each week. Designs should show critical thinking and experimentation.</p>
	<p><strong>Final Project and Presentation</strong> Due May 7th. Present your final project as a case study. Show process from initial problem statement to prototype. Presentation should touch upon important concepts discussed during class.</p>

	</ul>

	<h3>Resources</h3>

	<p>The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://library.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">The University (and associated) Libraries</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/" target="_blank">The University Learning Center</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/" target="_blank">University Disabilities Service</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.</p>

	<h3>Making Center</h3>
	<p>The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces that are situated across the New School to help students express their ideas in a variety of materials and methods.  We have resources to help support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work, photography and film, textiles, printmaking, 3D printing, manual and CNC machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide expertise and maintain the different shops and labs.  Safety is a primary concern, so each area has policies for access, training, and etiquette with which students and faculty should be familiar.  Many areas require specific orientations or trainings before access is granted.  Detailed information about the resources available, as well as schedules, trainings, and policies can be found at <a href="http://resources.parsons.edu" target="_blank">resources.parsons.edu</a>.</p>

	

	<h3>Grading Standards for Undergraduate Courses</h3>
	<p>A student’s final grades and GPA are calculated using a 4.0 scale.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A	Exceptional quality, above and beyond</li>
		<li>A-­	Very high quality work</li>
		<li>B+	High quality work demonstrating substantially higher than average abilities</li>
		<li>B	Very good work that satisfies all requirements</li>
		<li>B-	Good</li>
		<li>C+	Above-average work</li>
		<li>C	Average work, passable</li>
		<li>C-	Below average, passing work but below academic standing</li>
		<li>D	Poor quality work, no demonstration of understanding or abilities</li>
		<li>F	Failure, no credit</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Grade of W</strong> The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript.</p>

	<p><strong>Grade of Z</strong> The grade of Z is issued by an instructor to a student who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade.</p>

	<p><strong>Grade of Incomplete</strong> The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “F” by the Registrar’s Office.</p>

	<p><strong>Undergraduate students</strong> Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “F” by the Registrar’s Office. </p>

	<h3>Active Participation &amp; Attendance</h3>

	<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. </p> 

	<p>Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.</p>

	<p>hile attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>

	<p>I will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining your final grade.</p>

	<h3>College, School, Program and Class Policies</h3>
	<p>A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under Policies: A to Z. Students are also encouraged to consult the Academic Catalog for Parsons. </p>

	<h3>Canvas</h3>
	<p>Canvas will contain certain announcements and other items, but everything will be posted to the course website. Please check the <a href="https://dvschultz.github.io/PSD-WAMD-SP19/index.html">course website</a> before anywhere else.</p>

	<h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
	<p>The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.</p>

	<h3>Responsibility</h3>
	<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.</p>

	<h3>Academic Honesty &amp; Integrity</h3>				
	<p>Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</p>
						
	<p>Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found on the university website under <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/" target="_blank">Policies: A to Z</a>. Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/" target="_blank">Learning Center’s website</a>.</p>

	<p>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</p>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
	<p>The New School (the "university") seeks to encourage creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/provost/accreditation-policies/">the university website, on the Provost’s page.</a></p>
